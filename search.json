To be added to the Google Space please contact Selene Fregosi selene.fregosi@noaa.gov\nWe use GitHub projects to keep track of tasks and projects. All lab members are expected to check & respond to email, chats, and GitHub Projects regularly.\n\n\n\nSafety\n\nLab members are expected to follow all safety protocols. If they are not sure of the protocol, then they should request this information.\nLab members should never feel obligated to perform a task that they do not feel is safe.\nLab members are encouraged to speak up if they feel they need training to perform a specific task safely.\nIf lab members have a safety concern, they should bring it up with their supervisor or the other lab members.\nIf a lab member feels their safety concerns are not being taken seriously, or have any other lab safety questions, they can consult the acting PIFSC Safety Officer .\n\n\n\nData management\n\nWe use Google Drive, Google Cloud Platform, GitHub, and physical PIFSC servers to store and share data, documentation, and resources.\n\n\n\nWebsite Development\nAs described above, this website is intended to be a place for all glider team members to both use as a reference and contribute to. The website is built using Quarto, which uses text file .qmd files and markdown syntax to build content. .qmd files can be edited in any text editor, RStudio, or VSCode.
