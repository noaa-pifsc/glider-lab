There are several steps for data processing following a mission and they fall into two main categories: (1) glider operational and environmental data processing and (2) passive acoustic data processing. 

### Glider operational and environmental data processing

These data processing steps will generally follow the [Post-mission processing](https://sfregosi.github.io/agate/mission-processing.html) steps outlined in the _**agate**_ documentation. 

*More to come soon...*

### Passive acoustic data processing

See excellent protocols and information on the NMFS PAM-Glider site: [Analysis Methods > Acoustic Data Pre-Processing](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM-Glider/content/data_processing/AcousticData-preprocessing.html)

Specifically, the [Seaglider - WISPR](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM-Glider/content/data_processing/seaglider-wispr.html) instructions will apply to the PIFSC Seagliders.
