## **PIFSC Glider Lab Best Practices**

### **Communication**

<!-- 1.  We hold lab meetings regularly in which all members are expected to attend if their schedule allows. During these meetings all members are expected to contribute by sharing progress reports, discussing challenges, and celebrating successes. -->

2.  We use the PIFSC Gliders Google Space and Google Meet for informal discussions between lab members and project teams. To be added to the Google Space please contact Selene Fregosi [selene.fregosi@noaa.gov](selene.fregosi@noaa.gov)

3.  We use GitHub projects to keep track of tasks and projects. All lab members are expected to check & respond to email, chats, and GitHub Projects regularly.

### **Safety**

1.  Lab members are expected to follow all safety protocols. If they are not sure of the protocol, then they should request this information.

2.  Lab members should never feel obligated to perform a task that they do not feel is safe.

3.  Lab members are encouraged to speak up if they feel they need training to perform a specific task safely.

4.  If lab members have a safety concern, they should bring it up with their supervisor or the other lab members.

5.  If a lab member feels their safety concerns are not being taken seriously, or have any other lab safety questions, they can consult the acting PIFSC Safety Officer <contact info to be added>.

### **Data management**

1. We use Google Drive, Google Cloud Platform, GitHub, and physical PIFSC servers to store and share data, documentation, and resources. 

### **Website Development**

As described above, this website is intended to be a place for all glider team members to both use as a reference and contribute to. The website is built using Quarto, which uses text file `.qmd` files and markdown syntax to build content. `.qmd` files can be edited in any text editor, RStudio, or VSCode. For help contributing to this website, Use the 'Report an issue' link on the top left of this page to create a GitHub Issue and request assistance.
